# .cursorrules

## General Rules
- Never remove or break existing functionality when adding new features
- Always preserve current working code
- Add new features incrementally without modifying existing working parts
- Comment on any changes that might affect existing functionality
- Test that existing features still work after changes

## Code Style
- Always ensure ESLint compliance before making changes
- When adding console.log statements for debugging, use `// eslint-disable-next-line no-console` above each console statement
- Avoid unused variables and imports - remove them before committing
- Use proper React hooks dependency arrays to avoid warnings
- When in doubt about ESLint compliance, run the build locally first
- Check for unused variables before consider the job complete

## ESLint Compliance Rules
- NEVER ignore ESLint errors in production code
- For debugging console statements, always add eslint-disable comments
- Remove unused imports immediately after editing
- Fix missing dependency warnings in useEffect hooks
- Test builds locally before deployment to catch ESLint issues early
