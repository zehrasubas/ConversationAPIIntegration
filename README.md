# Facebook Login Integration - Getting Started

## üéØ Current Focus: Basic Facebook Login

We're focusing on getting **basic Facebook login** working first, before adding Messenger Platform features.

## ‚ùå Current Issues

Based on console logs:
- "User cancelled login or did not fully authorize"
- 401 errors on manifest.json 
- Facebook App configuration problems

## üîß Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Facebook App Configuration (CRITICAL)

**Go to [Facebook Developers Console](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)**
**Select your App ID: 30902396742455**

#### **App Domains** (Settings ‚Üí Basic):
```
your-vercel-domain.vercel.app
localhost
```

#### **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs** (Products ‚Üí Facebook Login ‚Üí Settings):
```
https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app/
http://localhost:3000/
```

#### **Site URL** (Products ‚Üí Facebook Login ‚Üí Settings):
```
https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app/
```

### 2. Required Products in Facebook App

Add these products to your app:
- ‚úÖ **Facebook Login** (Essential)
- ‚úÖ **Webhooks** (For later)

### 3. Basic Permissions (App Review ‚Üí Permissions)

For basic login, you only need:
- ‚úÖ `public_profile` (Default - no review needed)
- ‚úÖ `email` (Default - no review needed)

**Note:** No Advanced Access needed for basic login!

### 4. Test Users (if app is in Development Mode)

If your app is still in Development Mode:
- Go to **Roles ‚Üí Test Users**
- Add yourself as a Test User
- OR switch app to **Live Mode** (Settings ‚Üí Basic ‚Üí App Mode)

## üöÄ Deploy and Test

### Deploy to Vercel
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Test the Login
1. Visit your deployed app
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Click "Login with Facebook"
4. Check console for detailed logs

## üêõ Debugging Common Issues

### "User cancelled login or did not fully authorize"

**Most common causes:**
1. ‚ùå **App Domain missing** - Add your domain to App Domains
2. ‚ùå **Redirect URI missing** - Add your URL to Valid OAuth Redirect URIs  
3. ‚ùå **App in Development Mode** - Add yourself as Test User or switch to Live
4. ‚ùå **Wrong App ID** - Verify App ID `30902396742455` is correct

### 401 Errors on Static Files

**Quick fix:**
- The updated `vercel.json` should fix this
- If still happening, try clearing browser cache

### Facebook SDK Not Loading

**Console will show:**
- "Facebook SDK script loaded successfully" ‚úÖ
- "Facebook SDK initialized successfully" ‚úÖ
- If you see timeouts or errors, check browser network tab

## üöß What We're NOT Doing Yet

- Messenger Platform integration
- PSID exchange
- Advanced permissions

**Goal:** Get basic Facebook login working first, then we can add the messaging features later!
